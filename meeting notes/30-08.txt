Brainstorm/Discussion Fri 30 aug 2024

Integrated model --> model sensitivity pipeline
Analysis --> what genes are the most important 
What kind of experiments are the most important 

- Step 1 define resilience
--> Area and growth rate of leaves


- Step 2 experimental work
--> decide mutants, hormones measurements, decide/measurement relevant phenotype


- Step 3 data analysis 
--> RNAseq; phenotype analysis, GWAS; hormone analysis

- Step 4 developing model building blocks
--> noise incomplete data timescales --> Me
finding module --> ben
Infer interactions --> ben
Driver genes --> keygene
Identify link to phenotypes --> keygene

--> Mechanistic models: monica

- Step 5 model integration 
--> integrate ML + mechanistic --> Dick 
--> integrate hormonal genetic models with plant architecture --> Kirsten 

- Step 6 model sensitivity --> Me 
--> which changes optimise a trait
Key genes have the most effect
Model parts are most uncertain and require more data
Experiments to be more informative
(e.g. use framework Arabidopsis model Millar) 


- Step 7 validation and smart data experiments
--> Christa + Martijn
